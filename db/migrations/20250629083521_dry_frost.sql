  # Fix typing_sessions RLS policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing conflicting policies on typing_sessions table
    - Create new policies that work with custom authentication system
    - Allow public access for INSERT operations since users are managed through custom auth
    - Maintain data security by allowing users to only access their own sessions

  2. Changes Made
    - Remove authenticated user requirement for INSERT operations
    - Allow public INSERT access for typing_sessions
    - Keep SELECT policies for data access control
